UPDATE V3

I have added a software version that allow to control PiCamera V2 colour in order to create videos or images.

I is very basic implementation of PiCamera V2 and there is still some issues (for example, you must kill the program to stop it ; i don't know what's going on).

The Picamer V2 setup is very basic and setup options in my software are non fonctional BUT all the filters work properly.

This is a free use software ONLY for personal use.

If you want to use it (part of the software or all the software) for commercial use, contact me before.



UPDATE V2 version softwares

Some bugs corrections

# Video-and-Image-treatment-using-Python-OpenCV-and-CUDA

Those programs and routines are only for personal use and non commercial use.

If you want commercial use, please contact me.

Those 2 programs are written for Windows 10 PC but they can run on a Jetson Nano. Of course, you will need a Nvidia GPU because of CUDA routines.

Those programs require Python 3.7 (3.6 for Jetson Nno is OK).
You will need those Python libraries :
numpy
tkinter
PILLOW
OPENCV (4.0.0 and above)
Pycuda

Thoses programs allow Image or Video treatment, using mainly OpenCV and CUDA routines.

Those programs are not user friendly at all. I wrote them for my personal use and i did not plan to make it for other people.

The initial program can control a camera and make video and image acquisitions. The 2 program i provide here are an extraction of this initial program. That is to say all the commands to control the camera are not implemented.

Those programs can be used as they are with the Jetson Nano.

Those programs gets some bugs. I am not supposed to correct those bugs for you because i don't have time to.

I hope those programs and routines will interest you. It is very bad code writing and comments are really poor. I apologize for that but remember i wrote this program only for my personal use, that is to say those programs are really crappy.

I don't provide howto or reference manual. You will have to discover and test by yourself.

Good luck if you are fool enough to try to test those programs.

Best regards.
